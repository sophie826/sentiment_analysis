Programming Python is a book designed to take people who know Python and guide them on how to actually make it do things in the real world. It's important to note that the material in here (In the December 2014 4th edition) is for 3.X versions of Python and only deals with 2.X to the extent that the versions overlap, so you'll be better off with an earlier edition of the book (or another book designed to deal thoroughly with both versions) if you're working on a project that needs to work uusing earlier version of Python.
